Due to the inefficiency of the Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) scheme for
highly forward-peaked scattering, an angular multigrid method has been developed. 
The main results of previous works on this topic are recalled. For one 
dimensional problems, the scheme is very efficient but for multidimensional 
problems, the generalized scheme can become inefficient when the anisotropy 
increases too much. This is due to the fact that the scheme needs a filter to be
stable. In this work, the angular multigrid method has been recast as a
preconditioner for a Krylov solver instead of being used as an acceleration
method for a Source Iteration solver. The Krylov solver stabilizes the method
which does not need a filter anymore. The new method is shown to be faster and
to need less GMRES iterations than DSA preconditioning and sweep
preconditioning on two test problems.
