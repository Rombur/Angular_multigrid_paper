Standard acceleration technique based on DSA perform poorly when apply to the
$S_n$ equation for problem with highly forward peak scattering. Angular
multigrid methods have been developed to accelerate these calculations. 
The 1-D scheme is unconditionally stable but the extension of the method to
multidimensional geometries can become unstable when the anisotropy is too
high. A diffusive filter is needed to stabilize the method which is not as
efficient that the 1-D scheme. In this work, 
the angular multigrid method has been recast as a
preconditioner for a Krylov solver instead of being used as an acceleration
method for a Source Iteration solver. The Krylov solver stabilizes the method
and filtering is no longer required. The new method is shown to be faster and
needs significantly fewer GMRES iterations than DSA preconditioning and sweep
preconditioning on two test problems. The eigenvalue spectrum of the three
methods is compared. The proposed method gathers the eigenvalues and therefore, the
system requires less GMRES iterations to be solved.
