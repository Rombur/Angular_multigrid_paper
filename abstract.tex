Due to the inefficiency of the Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) scheme for
highly forward-peaked scattering, 1-D and 2-D angular multigrid methods have been developed. 
The 1-D scheme is unconditionally effective and very efficient but the 2-D
method can become inefficient when the anisotropy 
increases too much. This is due to the fact that the scheme needs a filter to be
stable. In this work, the angular multigrid method has been recast as a
preconditioner for a Krylov solver instead of being used as an acceleration
method for a Source Iteration solver. The Krylov solver stabilizes the method
which does not need a filter anymore. The new method is shown to be faster and
to need significantly fewer GMRES iterations than DSA preconditioning and sweep
preconditioning on two test problems.
