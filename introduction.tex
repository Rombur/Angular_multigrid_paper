\section{Introduction}
Highly anisotropic scattering is very common because it describes charged
particles scattering. The applications of charged particles transport are
legion and include radiotherapy, electronics hardening, etc. These particles 
interact through Coulomb interactions and therefore, undergo a lot of interactions 
but each one of them changes very slightly the energy and the direction of the 
particle. Because of
this, the magnitude of the scattering moments decreases very slowly and a high
number of moments is necessary to solve the problem accurately.\\
If the problem is very diffusive, it can be difficult to solve the transport
equation discretized by the discrete ordinate method. To speed up the
convergence, an acceleration scheme must be used. Standard acceleration schemes 
like Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA) focus on accelerating the isotropic 
part of flux, only the zeroth or the zeroth and the first flux 
moments are accelerated \cite{adams}. This is very efficient for neutron transport 
but not for charged particle transport. The spectral radius of the Source
Iteration (SI) method accelerated by DSA becomes arbitrary close to one when the 
anisotropy increases in a diffusive medium. Therefore other methods have been 
developed to accelerate higher order flux moments 
\cite{kassem,multigrid_1d,multigrid_2d}.\\
Morel an Manteuffel developed in \cite{multigrid_1d} an angular multigrid
method for the $S_n$ equations in one dimensional geometry. The angular
multigrid method uses a sequence of lower order transport operator and a
P1 operator to accelerate higher moments. For the scheme to be able to
work, an ``optimal'' transport correction has to be applied to each transport
operator. These transport corrections minimizes the ``high-frequency'' angular
errors. The results were very encouraging and Pautz et al. generalized this method 
to multidimensional geometry \cite{multigrid_2d}. This multidimensional
angular multigrid method needs to be stabilized in order to work. They proposed a 
filter which allows the scheme to be always stable but reduces the 
efficiency of the method compare to the one dimensional case. The spectral 
radius can now become arbitrary close to one when the anisotropy increases.
SI is not the only method to solve the $S_n$ equations, another one would be
to use a Krylov solver. Krylov solvers have been proven to be useful to
stabilize DSA in multidimensional geometry : ``using DSA as a preconditioner
for GMRES(m) removes the consistency requirement that plagues DSA-accelerated
source iteration in multidimensional problems'' \cite{ttg}. Driven by this
property, we propose to use the angular multigrid as a preconditioner for a 
Krylov solver instead of an acceleration scheme for the Source Iteration
method. The Krylov solver stabilizes the method and therefore the filter becomes
unnecessary. The paper is organized as follows; in Section 2, we present the
notation and the discretized transport equation,  we recall the
previous works done on this topic and the method that we propose, in Section
3, we show some results and in Section 4, we end with the conclusion.
